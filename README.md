# SENS (Sensory Emotion Neural System)

## 功能簡介

SENS 是 MorphusAI 專門的情緒理解模組，專為處理中文對話而設計，旨在讓我們的人格模型能夠更深層次地理解對話中的情緒，並做出更人性化的反應。SENS 模組基於50萬筆已標記的中文對話數據進行訓練，能夠分類和分析以下五種主要情緒：

1. **喜**（よろこび）
2. **怒**（いかり）
3. **哀**（かなしみ）
4. **楽**（たのしみ）
5. **怖**（おそれ）

### 核心功能

- **情緒分類**: SENS 能夠準確地分類中文對話中的情緒，提升模型對情緒的識別能力。
- **實時情緒分析**: 能夠對實時中文對話數據進行情緒分析，並根據分析結果提供適當的反應建議。

### 應用場景

- **用戶支持系統**: 提升中文客服系統的情緒感知能力，讓客服回應更具同理心。
- **智能助手**: 使AI助手能夠更好地理解和回應用戶的情緒需求。
- **對話分析**: 對歷史中文對話數據進行情緒分析，幫助識別情緒趨勢和問題點。

## Features Overview

SENS is a proprietary emotion understanding module of MorphusAI, specifically designed for processing Chinese conversations. It enables our persona models to deeply understand emotions in conversations and respond more humanely. The SENS module is trained on 500,000 labeled Chinese conversation data points and can classify and analyze the following five primary emotions:

1. **Joy** (喜 - よろこび)
2. **Anger** (怒 - いかり)
3. **Sadness** (哀 - かなしみ)
4. **Happiness** (楽 - たのしみ)
5. **Fear** (怖 - おそれ)

### Core Features

- **Emotion Classification**: SENS can accurately classify emotions in Chinese conversations, enhancing the model's ability to recognize emotions.
- **Real-Time Emotion Analysis**: Capable of analyzing emotions in real-time Chinese conversation data and providing appropriate response suggestions based on the analysis.

### Application Scenarios

- **Customer Support Systems**: Enhancing the emotional awareness of Chinese customer service systems, making responses more empathetic.
- **Intelligent Assistants**: Enabling intelligent assistants to better understand and respond to users' emotional needs in Chinese.
- **Conversation Analysis**: Analyzing historical Chinese conversation data to identify emotional trends and issues.
